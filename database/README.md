# Circular Economy Digital Hub Database Documentation

## Overview
The database component of the Circular Economy Digital Hub is designed to manage and store data efficiently. This documentation provides an overview of the database structure, configuration, and usage.

## Directory Structure
- **migrations/**: Contains SQL files for database schema migrations.
  - `init.sql`: SQL commands to initialize the database schema.
  
- **seeds/**: Contains SQL files for seeding the database with initial data.
  - `seed.sql`: SQL commands to populate the database with sample data.
  
- **config.js**: Configuration settings for database connections, including connection strings and options.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Database Configuration**: 
   - Update the `config.js` file with your database connection details.
   - Ensure that the database server is running and accessible.

2. **Running Migrations**:
   - Execute the SQL commands in `migrations/init.sql` to set up the initial database schema.
   - Use a database client or command line tool to run the SQL file.

3. **Seeding the Database**:
   - After migrations, run the SQL commands in `seeds/seed.sql` to populate the database with initial data.
   - This step is optional but recommended for testing purposes.

## Best Practices
- Regularly back up your database to prevent data loss.
- Use version control for your migration and seed files to track changes over time.
- Test your database queries and operations in a development environment before deploying to production.

## Additional Resources
- Refer to the official documentation of your database management system for more detailed instructions on setup and management.
- For any issues or questions, consult the project repository or reach out to the development team.
