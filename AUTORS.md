# Circular Economy Digital Hub: A Platform for Awareness, Collaboration, and Action

## Mission Statement
Our mission is to establish a centralized digital platform that educates, connects, and empowers students, faculty, and external partners in circular economy activities. The platform will facilitate knowledge-sharing, monitor sustainability projects, and promote involvement in activities that minimize waste and foster sustainable practices on campus and off.

## Project Description

### Background & Problem Statement
Many students and faculty members are interested in sustainability but lack an easy-to-access platform to learn, engage, and collaborate on circular economy initiatives. Without proper tracking and coordination, many sustainability efforts remain isolated, limiting their impact.

### Solution
We propose developing a software-based Circular Economy Hub, which will serve as:
- An educational resource (articles, reports, tutorials on circular economy principles).
- A collaboration space (forum for discussions, student-led research, event management).
- A project tracker (monitor campus sustainability initiatives, measure impact).
- A challenge & rewards system (encouraging participation in sustainability efforts).

### Key Features & Functionalities
- User Accounts & Profiles (Students, faculty, external partners)
- Circular Economy Knowledge Center (Articles, reports, project case studies)
- Event Management System (Workshops, hackathons, guest lectures)
- Collaboration Hub (Forum, chat rooms, idea submission)
- Project Dashboard (Track progress of sustainability projects)
- Gamification System (Challenges, leaderboards, and rewards for sustainability efforts)
- Interactive Map (Track waste collection points, sustainability efforts on campus)

### Target Audience/Beneficiaries
- **Students**: Gain knowledge, skills, and project opportunities in circular economy.
- **Faculty & Staff**: Engage in research collaborations and lead sustainability efforts.
- **External Partners**: Connect with students, support initiatives, and implement solutions in real-world settings.

### Feasibility and Scope
- **Feasibility**: The project will be implemented as a web-based platform with a user-friendly interface. Technologies employed: React (Frontend), Node.js (Backend), MongoDB/PostgreSQL (Database), Firebase (Authentication).
- **Scope & Timeline**:
  - Phase 1 (1 Month): Research & UI/UX Design
  - Phase 2 (2 Months): Core Feature Development (User Authentication, Knowledge Center, Forum)
  - Phase 3 (1 Month): Testing & Deployment

### Learning Outcomes
Through this project, the team will:
- Acquire hands-on experience in full-stack software development.
- Gain knowledge about sustainability and circular economy concepts.
- Improve skills in UI/UX design, project management, and collaboration.
- Create an impact-driven digital product with real-world applications.

### Team Roles
- **Project Manager**: Focuses on planning, development, and coordination.
- **Frontend Developer**: Designs and builds the UI (React).
- **Backend Developer**: Implements authentication, data management, and APIs (Node.js).
- **Database Administrator**: Manages data storage and retrieval.
- **UI/UX Designer**: Develops user-friendly designs and enhances the user experience.
- **Sustainability Researcher**: Keeps track of how the project will align with the circular economy goals.

### Anticipated Challenges and Risk Management
- **Technical Complexity**: Proper documentation, modular programming.
- **User Engagement**: Reach the community through campus events.
- **Scalability**: ALU as pilot followed by other universities and institutions.

### Success Metrics
- **User Adoption**: Number of students, faculties, and partners using the platform.
- **Engagement Levels**: Number of discussions carried out, projects initiated, and events held.
- **Impact Measurement**: Decrease in campus waste, project completion rate.
